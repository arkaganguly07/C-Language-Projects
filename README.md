# C-Language-Projects
This is a repository for C Language Projects. Here I'm going to upload any C Projects, big or small, for the coders.

## Explanations
-> rand() is used to generate a series of random numbers. The random number is generated by using an algorithm that gives a series of non-related numbers whenever this function is called.

-> srand() gives the random function a new seed, a starting point (usually random numbers are calculated by taking the previous number (or the seed) and then do many operations on that number to generate the next).

-> time(0) gives the time in seconds since the Unix epoch, which is a pretty good "unpredictable" seed (you're guaranteed your seed will be the same only once, unless you start your program multiple times within the same second).

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
